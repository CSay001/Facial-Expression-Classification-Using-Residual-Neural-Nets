# Facial-Expression-Classification-Using-Residual-Neural-Nets
In this lesson, I implemented deep learning models, specifically focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend, to build and train a Facial Expression Classification model.
#
The project covers:

Theoretical Foundations: Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Neural Networks, Residual Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. The documentation provides insights into how these architectures work and their impact on modern machine learning.

Model Implementation: Learn how to build and train deep learning models using CNNs and Residual blocks. The code is implemented in Keras with TensorFlow 2.0 as the backend, demonstrating best practices in model construction, training, and optimization.

Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained CNN models through various key performance indicators (KPIs). The repository includes scripts and tools for evaluating model accuracy, robustness, and generalization to ensure effective results.
