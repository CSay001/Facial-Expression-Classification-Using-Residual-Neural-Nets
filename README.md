# Facial-Expression-Classification-Using-Residual-Neural-Nets
In this lesson, I implemented deep learning models, specifically focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend, to build and train a Facial Expression Classification model.
